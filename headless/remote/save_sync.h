// A game's save data kept in step with a profile's save store (save_store.h), the same way for
// every backend: the console's save folder of the game is packed (save_archive.h), the store says
// whether its copy or the console's is newer, and the newer one goes to the other side. When both
// changed since they were last the same (played on two devices without a sync between), the
// player chooses; nothing is overwritten without that. Which side changed is told by the save
// data itself: the console keeps what each game's was when it was last in step, on both sides
// (<store>/synced.json), so a store that only compares times (RomM, when another device's
// version came in since) does not replace save data changed on the console.
// Save data replaced on the console is first moved to a backup folder (the last few of each game
// are kept).
//
// Blocking (the network), and on no thread of its own: the caller runs it where waiting is fine.
