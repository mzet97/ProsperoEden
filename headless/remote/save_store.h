// A save store: a place that keeps the save data of a profile's games besides the console, as one
// packed file (a zip, save_archive.h) per game. Each kind of server that can keep save data is a
// backend that implements this interface (backends.h); save_sync.h decides what to do with a
// game's save data, the same way for every backend, and does it through this. A backend only
// talks to its server.
//
// A store is made for a profile's entry in save-sync.json, with a folder of its own on the console
// for what it keeps between starts (the device it is to the server, for example).
