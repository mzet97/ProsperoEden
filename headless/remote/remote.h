// Download sources: places on the network that have Switch games (source.h), listed in the
// Library beside the games on the console. A game is downloaded to the game files folder when it
// is played or put in the download queue; nothing is streamed: it runs from its file on the
// console, as one copied there by hand. The same game on several sources is one title that can be
// downloaded from any of them (SameGame tells), and a game already on the console is not offered.
//
// The sources are set up in config/remote/sources.json, which the player writes (over FTP, like
// the keys); each entry names its backend's "type" (backends.cpp), an optional "name" for the menu,
// and what the backend needs (see its header, remote/<type>/):
//
//   { "sources": [ { "type": "<type>", "name": "Home", ... } ] }
//
// What is kept, in config/remote/: queue.json (the download queue, one for all sources, so it goes
// on after the app was closed) and <source>/catalog.json (each source's game list, so the Library
// shows it at once and without a network); the covers go with the others (covers/remote-...tga).
//
// A download is written to the game files folder's .remote-downloads/<source>/<game>/, its
// contents checked as they come (stream_check.h; a damaged file is deleted), and, once all of the
// game's files are complete, moved to their places: the game's file to roms/, its
// updates and DLC to updates/, so those only ever hold whole files of whole games. One that stopped (the app closed, a game started, the network went
// away) goes on from where it was, its last 4 MB fetched again in case of a power cut;
// .remote-downloads/ keeps nothing else (a cancel deletes a game's folder, the next start whatever
// is not queued). Everything runs on two threads of this file's own; the menu only reads their
// state.
